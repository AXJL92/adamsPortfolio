### [Football Fixture List Tracker]([https://github.com/adamlewis/project](https://github.com/AXJL92/footballFixtureTracker))
- **Description**: The Football Fixture List Tracker is a Python-based script designed to automate the process of retrieving a football team's upcoming matches from an external API. It simplifies the task of keeping track of all games for your chosen football club by using an API token for authentication to fetch the latest fixture data. The script regularly checks for new fixtures and sends email notifications to remind users about upcoming matches, ensuring they never miss a game. This project demonstrates the integration of APIs and email services to build a useful and practical tool for football enthusiasts.
